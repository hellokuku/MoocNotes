Other useful links.

* [/r/learnprogramming]() - A growing reddit community about learning programming.

* [The Wiki]() - Very detailed wiki with tons of information for the beginning programmer.

* [The FAQ]() - General questions a new programmer can have that might be not answered in the lectures.

(APPARENTLY THE SITE IS DOWN AND I GUESS WE ARE PARTIALLY INVOLVED. BE SURE TO CHECK IT OUT WHEN IT'S BACK ONLINE)

* [Koans of unit tests]() You get a set of failing unit tests that you must fix. Starts very basic and goes up to OOP and then some. Useful if you want extra practice with Python and works well with this class (so far - week 4).
